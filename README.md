# BitList-and-Books
The implementation of a Python class, BitList, in a file named bits.py, with methods to create a series of bits from a binary string or integers, perform bitwise operations (such as AND), and manipulate the bits through shifting, while also incorporating custom exceptions for error handling, and passing unit tests outlined in bits_test.py.
